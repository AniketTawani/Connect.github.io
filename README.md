During my journey in Engineering, I faced one problem i.e. not having proper guidance from the
correct people at the right time. This is the main reason which motivates me to build "CONNECT"
for my fellow mates as well as for the juniors. Through "CONNECT" he/she can directly reach out
to the industry person with whom he/she is willing to work, with the help of the Linkedin
platform. (The link for the connection is provided by CONNECT itself) Because of "CONNECT" you
can completely resolve your query related of any kind, for ex: It may be related to the
academics, placements preparation, and proper content for the preparation of DSA by reaching out
to them for help.
